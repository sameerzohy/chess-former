# --- Core Chess Logic & Data Handling ---
# The standard, highly-featured chess library for Python.
# Essential for parsing PGN, generating legal moves, checking game termination, etc.
python-chess==1.0.0
# Note: You can also look into 'bulletchess' if you hit performance bottlenecks 
# during large-scale PGN processing, but 'python-chess' is the reliable standard.

# --- Deep Learning Framework (PyTorch) ---
# PyTorch is recommended for its flexibility and dynamic graph, which aids in
# building and debugging custom Transformer architectures and MCTS logic.
torch==2.3.0
torchvision==0.18.0
torchaudio==2.3.0

# --- Transformer Architecture (Optional but Highly Recommended) ---
# While you can build the Transformer from scratch using 'torch.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer',
# this library provides robust, pre-built components and utilities (like attention layers).
# If you plan to stick purely to a custom Encoder stack, you may skip this,
# but it simplifies advanced Transformer components.
# transformers==4.42.0

# --- Scientific Computing & Utilities ---
# The foundation of all numerical computing in Python (for tensors, arrays, etc.).
numpy==1.26.4
# Used for efficient array/data handling, especially when working with large PGN datasets.
pandas==2.2.2
# Essential for plotting training loss, policy accuracy, and Elo rating progression.
matplotlib==3.8.4
scikit-learn==1.5.0
